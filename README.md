# Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program

## Project Summary

This project involved creating a simple item-tracking program for Corner Grocer to analyze their list of items purchased throughout the day. The goal was to help the store in rearranging their produce section effectively by analyzing how often items are purchased.

## What Did I Do Well?

All requested menu options were successfully implemented, including generating a frequency count and a text-based histogram of items. The code is well-documented and utilizes classes and maps for efficient data manipulation.

## Areas for Enhancement

1. Make it more easily scalable for larger datasets and more frequent queries.
2. More robust input validation to handle various edge cases that were not included.
3. Add additional useful options, such as remove an item (intiated functionality but not finalized and unused).

## Challenges

Implementing the histogram was challenging due to the string manipulation and formatting that is quite different than what I'm used to in other programs. I used the STL `<iomanip>` library for better control over output. For support, I frequently referred to C++ forums or course resources.

## Transferable Skills

1. File I/O operations
2. Use of C++ maps
3. Data parsing and manipulation
4. Input validation and error handling techniques

## Code Maintainability

1. Followed coding standards, used encapsulation, and added in-line comments.
2. Chose meaningful names for variables and functions.
